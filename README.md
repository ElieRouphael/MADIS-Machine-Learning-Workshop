# MADIS Machine Learning Workshop

This repository contains a practical notebook designed for the **MADIS Machine Learning Workshop**. The goal is to introduce a wide range of machine learning techniques in Python, from classical algorithms to advanced deep learning and federated learning.

## Notebook

- `TP_MADIS_Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Main notebook covering:

### Classical Machine Learning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- KMeans and KMeans++

### Deep Learning
- Neural Networks (NN)
- Transfer Learning
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Transformers

### Specialized Topics
- Anomaly Detection
- Time Series Analysis
- Federated Learning
